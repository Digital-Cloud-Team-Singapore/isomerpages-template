<p>Since 2003, all Singapore residents aged 15 have been able to apply for a SingPass ID/password to transact with the Government via online e-services.</p>

<p>The enhanced SingPass system was launched in July 2015 which includes an improved user interface, mobile-friendly features and stronger security capabilities, such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for e-government transactions, particularly for those involving sensitive data. This one-time “second factor” password is delivered through Short Messaging Service (SMS) or an “OneKey” token.</p>

<p>The SingPass authentication system strives to provide users with a high level of confidence by allowing an alphanumeric password that can be as long as 24 characters, to enable end-to-end encryption of user IDs and passwords, thereby promising a high level of availability and resiliency. SingPass also enhances internal Government efficiency by eliminating the need for each agency to develop and administer its own authentication system.</p>

<p>Examples of improved measures taken over the years to better protect users’ personal information include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users will be prompted to change passwords to stronger ones every two years.</li>
  <li>Passwords of accounts that are inactive for more than three years will be reset to ensure that users with dormant accounts are not unnecessarily exposed to cyber threats.</li>
  <li>After three failed login attempts, users will be asked to key in a randomly-generated security code to mitigate brute force attacks on login.</li>
  <li>Any change made to the account holder’s key personal information will trigger a notification letter, which will be sent to the user’s registered address to verify this change.</li>
</ul>
