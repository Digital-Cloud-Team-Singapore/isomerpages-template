<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industryâ€™s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</li>
  <li>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.</li>
    <li>Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="why-do-we-use-it"><strong>Why do we use it?</strong></h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using â€˜Content here, content hereâ€™, making it look like readable English.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for â€˜lorem ipsumâ€™ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Various versions have evolved over the <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/search?q=year&amp;oq=year&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61j0l4.326j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">years</a></li>
      <li>sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
