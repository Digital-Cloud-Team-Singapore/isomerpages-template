I"{<p>The Social Service Sector experiences dynamic changes in the review and deployment of programmes to better serve clients’ needs.</p>

<p>The sector aspires to address challenges in greater demand for skilled manpower, the pressing need for more prevalent data in service planning, and greater demand from clients on better and more effective service delivery. The demand continues to grow due to a combination of socio-economic trends such as rapidly ageing population, smaller family sizes, widening income gap and increasing economic volatility.</p>

<p>As part of the effort to drive productivity and service improvements, the Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech), together with Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) have embarked on Social Service Sector ICT Master Plan, or SSICT in short, to enable the government and social service providers to deliver coordinated and integrated social services through the adoption of ICT.</p>

<p>The vision of the Social Service Sector is to “Inspire responsible individuals to live a life of dignity and purpose in an inclusive society, where they are empowered and are able to achieve self-sustenance.” To accomplish this, SSICT aims to raise the ICT capability of social service providers, and equip social service personnel with more ICT tools to drive productivity and innovation. It will jump-start the ICT eco-system for agencies that have not begun their ICT journey, and raise the level of ICT capability and usage for those that have already embraced ICT in their operations.</p>

<p><strong>The three key strategies of SSICT are:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Strategy 1 - Innovative use and adoption of ICT to build VWO capability: This strategy will enhance the effectiveness and capability of the VWOs through the use of ICT as an enabler to maximise productivity and improve service delivery.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strategy 2 - Create a conducive client-centric environment: This strategy will provide an environment to enable the social service workers to deliver connected, seamless and accessible social services to the clients. Its aim is to ensure that clients receive timely and effective end-to-end assistance. This environment will provide visibility of the assistance extended to each household member as well as total assistance provided, so that an overview of the total assistance provided to each household can be established. Through this, more holistic help / solution can be designed to help those in need.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Strategy 3 - Streamline and simplify information management: This strategy will enhance the collection, sharing and use of information within the sector so as to facilitate strategic and operational planning of social services.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Social Service Sector comprises five sub-sectors namely:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Family services - families in need of support;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Elderly services - seniors in need of support;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Children disability services - children with special needs aged 0-18 years;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adult disability services - persons with disabilities aged 16-55 years; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>
